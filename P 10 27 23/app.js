// Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

// Instructions
// Go to CodePen and create a new pen.
// Create a new JavaScript file by clicking on the "JS" tab at the bottom of the screen.
// Write a JavaScript program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 following the rules above.
// Test your program by running it using the "Console" feature in CodePen.
// Submit your CodePen URL to your instructor.
// Requirements
// The program should print the numbers from 1 to 100.
// For multiples of three, the program should print "Fizz" instead of the number.
// For multiples of five, the program should print "Buzz" instead of the number.
// For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, the program should print "FizzBuzz".
// The program should be written in JavaScript and should be submitted as a CodePen URL.
// The program should be properly formatted and commented.
// Tips
// You can use a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 100.
// You can use the modulus operator (%) to determine if a number is divisible by another number.
// You can use the console.log()method to print output to the console.
