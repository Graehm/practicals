// Given a number as an input, print out every integer from 1 to that number. However, when the integer is divisible by 3, print out “Fizz”; when it’s divisible by 5, print out “Buzz”; when it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, print out “Fizz Buzz”.

//p:a number
//r: return a string fizzbuzz, fizz,or buzz
//e: 1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz
//p: create a loop from 1 to input n then for each iteration check if number is first divisible by both 3,5 if so log ("fizzbuzz") else if is divisible by 3 log (fizz) else if divisible by 5 log(fizzbuzz)
